### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an Aerospace Engineering student at Iowa State. :tornado: :airplane:
I, also, work part time for Collins Aerospace as a Quality Engineering intern.
I have some coding experience but this is my first time using Github So I'm not sure what I am looking to use this for other than class yet. :man_shrugging:
I have interests in some graphic design work and game modding, especially for EU4.
